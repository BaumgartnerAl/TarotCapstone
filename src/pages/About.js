            <p>Faceless Tarot is a project I created for a college class. I designed every aspect of this project myself, from the cards to this web app.
                This project was an opportunity for me to dive into a topic I knew relatively nothing about and research and design a complete project. I based the designs off the 
                Rider-Waite Tarot deck, using the symbolism and imagery found there. <br></br><br></br>The origins of tarot cards are heavily debated and mysterious, so I wanted to capture some of that mystery in my designs.
                The decision to make every character faceless was both an aesthetic choice and an attempt to add more meaning into the deck.<br></br><br></br>The divination process is very simple,
                only using one card instead of a more advanced spread of cards. This practice is adapted from other simple tarot divinations, and the actions recommended beforehand were suggested in the
                Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by A.E Waite. This handbook also supplied the divinatory meanings for this deck. Some of them were slightly adapted, but most were taken directly from Waite's book.
